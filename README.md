# twrp-kltecanactive
Unofficial TWRP recovery for the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active (SM-G870x). Specifically the SM-G870W model (kltecanactive).

Built from source, based from the original recovery image using the official TWRP manifest: https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni/tree/twrp-6.0

It might not work with your device if you don't own the SM-G870W model. Use at your own risk.

There's three variants for the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active: "A" "W" and "F". The latter one being the most popular and the most maintained, and the "A" variant has a locked bootloader sooo...

Supported Device List:

--SM-G870W

Tell me if it works with your model and I'll update the supported device list.
